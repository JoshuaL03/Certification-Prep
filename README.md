# Certification Prep
This project is a practice program designed to help prepare for the CPA Exam, for the Certified Associate Programmer Certification. I have worked on it from October to December 2021. I started the project already being moderately proficient in C++, but I have learned much more over the course of its progression. 

The project was made for an assignment as well as practice.
I worked on the project for COP 3003 at Florida Gulf Coast University.
